# Vim Notes

This is just a test page for editing Vim and will be the base document I use for practice. I wont be building too many actual notes because Vim is built with a manual page. As a result, I need to get better at reading manual pages vice taking a lot of notes.  

Don't forget to set your vimrc file again. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/
