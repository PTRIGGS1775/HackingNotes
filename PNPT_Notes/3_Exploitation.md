# Exploitation

- Whenever you find an application you should look for the version number. When you find that search for the exploit.

- If you don't know what something is then you need to do the research to understand what's going on better.

## Web Application

### Web Application: Enumeration
***

- Leverage [HTTP Enumeration](2_Enumeration.md#https-80-8080-443)
- Enumerte for subdomains. These will be useful in finding other locations that web applications may be stored.
    - Below is a series of commands you can run to enumerate subdomains.
    - Alternatively, you can run the [domainenum.sh](../tools/domainenum.sh) script (credit to Heath Adams).
    - test, dev, and admin are some examples of potentially juicy sub domains.

````bash
# 1. Enumerate subdomains
# Assetfinder: 
assetfinder {url.com}

# Amass:
amass enum -d {url}.com}

# 2. Check if subdomains are alive with httprobe
# First you'll need to store any found subdomains in a file.

cat {name of subdomain txt file} | httprobe

# 3. Capture screenshots of the webpage to immediately find once valuable on large amounts of domains.
