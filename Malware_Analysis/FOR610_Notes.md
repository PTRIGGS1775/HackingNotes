This page is designed to keep track of all relevant commands and tools during the FOR610 course. This is organized by course days but will be sorted by task details later.

- Use your lab to examine the network traffic and packet. Then use a connected machine in the cloud, perhaps a tails instance to pull the malware. To take it a step further you could purchase the space with gift cards.
- Malware bazaar is a place to look at malware samples or github malware repo (the zoo) or vx underground or [malware-traffic-analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/).
# Day 1

## Static Analysis:
- Process
    1. Review strings with `floss`
    2. Review structure with `pestudio` (Win) and `peframe` (Lin) and `detectiteasy` (both)

### Review Strings
- The goal is to be looking for import information, windows APIs or other details that can indicate the nature of the malware.
```bash
# Floss.
floss {mal.exe} 
```

### Review structure of PE
- Look at headers and imports and check to see any anomolies.
```bash
# PEStudio
## GUI based and easy to click through.
"Drag and drop the exe into the PEStudio window"

# PEFrame
## Takes a minute or so to run depending on size. XLM Error is expected. Shows behavior and possible investigation tools.
peframe {mal.exe}

#Detect it easy
## Shows you how the exe was compiled and other useful buttons with similar functionality to other tools in the course.
