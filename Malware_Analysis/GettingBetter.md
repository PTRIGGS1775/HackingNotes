This page is designed to keep track of all relevant commands and tools during the FOR610 course. This is organized by course days but will be sorted by task details later.

- Use your lab to examine the network traffic and packet. Then use a connected machine in the cloud, perhaps a tails instance to pull the malware. To take it a step further you could purchase the space with gift cards.
- Malware bazaar is a place to look at malware samples or github malware repo (the zoo) or vx underground or [malware-traffic-analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/).

Day 6 Hints
- Process moved into ESI is called later in a function CALL ESI. Its only called in the call not the MOV
- Do a complete scan of the code when deobfuscating stack strings. Other string values may be listed elsewhere.
- If something is compressed they are probaly trying to hide something from you. Investigate API calls to this.
- Follow things in dump to view decompressed data.
- You may see a call EDI need to figure out what EDI is doing, this was referenced during exercise b5p48
- Functions may not be obvious b5p70
- Save trivia for the end
- Disable ASLR as part of your first step before debugging
    - set scylla hide
    - disable exceptions
- If your dumped malware from dbg doesn't run, it may need to decode further.
