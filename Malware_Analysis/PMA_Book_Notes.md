# Basic Static Analysis
## File Headers
`compile timestamps` All Delphi programs use a compile time of June 19, 1992. If you see that compile time, you’re probably looking at a Delphi program, and you won’t really know when it was compiled. In addition, a competent malware writer can easily fake the compile time. If you see a compile time that makes no sense, it probably was faked.

## Hash
`CertUtil -hashfile yourFileName MD5` Get the hash and pass to virus total.

## Random Notes
- Its important to note not just what files are imported, but from where those functions are being imported and research both.

- To unpack files you need to specify an output name or it wont work.
    - `upx -o {unpacked-lab01-02.exe} -d { Lab01-02.exe}`

- Using Resource Hacker
    - Drag the file to resource hacker.
    - Save the resource as a bin.
    - Treat the bin like any exe during analysis.

# Basic Dynamic Analysis
## Process
1. Running procmon and setting a filter on the malware executable name and clearing out all events just before running.

2. Starting Process Explorer.

3. Gathering a first snapshot of the registry using Regshot.

4. Setting up your virtual network to your liking using INetSim and ApateDNS.

5. Setting up network traffic logging on Remnux box:
    - `sudo wireshark`
    - run `nc -l -p 443` and `nc -l -p 80` in two separte tabs.
